        <div className='answer'>
          I like to build and create a lot of different things. Rather than have
          a small section for each or try to mix them in with other things I did
          a general section to fit them into.

        <div className='question'>Virtual Pinball Cabinet</div>
        <div className='project-description'>
          I was introduced to one of these from my Highschool girlfriends dad
          and decided to try to build one myself. loaded up with over 200
          different virtual pinball tables. Using programs like Visual Pinball
          and PinballFX. Wired up with light up buttons, strobes, cabinet
          lights, sirens, and a fan. This is one of my most complete project's
          I've worked on. Currently I'm rebuilding it in order to do some wire
          managment and finish up some other addons with some more to come like
          a bell and a knocker.

        <div className='question'>Game Ogre!</div>
        <div className='project-description'>
          This is a Virtual Arcade cabinet. This contains over 3000 games and
          runs everthing, I know of, Nintendo 64 and older. Currently it only
          works with joystick and button, or controller games some aiming guns
          for arcade shooters are currently being developed that will work with
          the modern screens I'm hoping to add that capability to this project.
          It also still needs to be painted and add a few other finishing
          touches.

        <div className='question'>Desk</div>
        <div className='project-description'>
          I built this desk to take with me to my apartment when I lived in
          provo. I wanted the open shelves so I could place a projector on it so
          I could work at my desk comfortably and still have a TV-Show on in the
          background.
        </div>
        <div className='question'>Table</div>
        <div className='project-description'>
          Made out of red-wood this is probably one of the coolest things I've
          made. Custom made to hold my TV and a shelf to keep my gaming consoles
          off the carpet.

        <div className='question'>Wood Engraving</div>
        <div className='project-description'>
          Starting out by hand I enjoy doing some pyrography. I like the smell
          of burning wood and how it looks. More Recently I've invested in a
          Laser engraver and have created family plaques for my mom and
          siblings, wooden Christmas ornaments, and some other things.

        <div className='question'>What is to come?</div>
        <div className='answer'>
          I recently got a 3D printer and am learning how to use it as well as
          am learning 3D modeling software Blender to create my own personal
          things. Any other furnature I would like to custom make in the future.
          As I'm learning Blender I'd love to make a 3D animation of some kind,
          ideas are still in the works. 3D print and create my own models for
          Dungeons and Dragons. I'd love a project car as well.
