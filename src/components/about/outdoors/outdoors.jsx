        <div className='question'>What type of Motorcycling?</div>
        <div className='answer'>
          Both riding dirt bikes off road and riding a road bike. I own a Yamaha
          R3 and enjoy a weekend ride up a canyon or ride around Utah lake,
          given an opportunity I would not pass up on a chance to go ride dirt
          bikes either.

        <div className='answer'>
          Yeah, growing up my family would go on a yearly camping trip over the
          summer with my extended family. We would usually go to a place called
          Potters Ponds. We would go on 4-Wheeler rides, my favorite is trail
          #5. We would also have Airsoft wars in the forested areas, and always
          do a friday night movie, using a projector we would watch a movie
          while it was dark by the fire.
