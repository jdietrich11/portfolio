        <div className='question'>What is your dream car?</div>
        <div className='answer'>
          1969-1972 Chevrolet Chevelle is my dream project car. 2015 Ferrari 488
          is my dream super car. 2013-2016 Audi S4 is my 'Realistic' dream car.
          2016 Apollo Arrow is my most unrealistic dream car.

        <div className='question'>What cars have you owned?</div>
        <div className='answer'>
          My first car was a 2001 Audi S4 and is my favorite car i've owned.
          From there I briefly owned a 2015 Kia Optima. I traded that car in for
          a 2013 Camaro SS which I drove for awhile. Due to the bills that came
          along with school I had to give that up and now currently drive a 2012
          Dodge Avenger SXT.

        <div className='question'>What car would you like to get next?</div>
        <div className='answer'>
          Likely, I'll get a 2013-2016 Audi S4. I'm also tempted to pick up a
          Mazda MX-5, 2015 Ford Focus ST, A Corvette, or another Camaro. Due to
          gas prices I'm also tempted towards a Tesla or Cheverolet Volt.

        <div className='question'>What about racing?</div>
        <div className='answer'>
          Over the past few years I've started to lightly follow F1 racing. I
          really like the current rivalry between Lewis Hamilton and Max
          Verstappen. For the first time I actually watched an entire race,
          which was the 2021 final race in Abu Dhabi. I really enjoyed it and am
          counting down the days till the 2022 season. Though I'm not happy with
          how that particular race ended and hope the people in charge of F1
          make some changes for this upcoming season.
        </div>
        <div className='question'>Do you have a favorite team?</div>
        <div className='answer'>
          Yes, I root for the Corvette racing team in GT class and Mercedes-Benz
          in F1.
