          <div className='question'>Why Programming?</div>
          <div className='answer'>
            I started programming because back in January 2021 I changed jobs. I
            became a graveyard shift Security Guard. I filled my time with
            watching movies, tv-shows, and a-lot of YouTube. As this was getting
            old after awhile I began to wonder how YouTuber B is for Build
            started his channel and having a desire to also work on a project
            car. I started doing research as to what he did professionaly. He
            was a Software Engineer. I started digging deeper and found it did
            not require a degree. I spoke with my cousin Jeremy Robertson who is
            a developer as well. He recommended I get my feet wet and try it
            out. I fell in love with it from there!

          <div className='question'>How did you start?</div>
          <div className='answer'>
            I began by taking an HTML and CSS course on UDEMY. My cousin Jeremy
            recommended that I learn JavaScript and not make a decision until I
            built a BlackJack game using it. So on UDEMY I took mulitiple
            JavaScript courses in order to better understand it. Then I built my
            game. He told me that programming is a-lot of smacking your head
            against a wall but once you get passed it, it can feel great. Being
            a person who likes to solve puzzles, this drew more interest.
          </div>
          <div className='question'>Where did you go from there?</div>
          <div className='answer'>
            I started taking more and more courses on UDEMY. React, MYSQL, C++,
            CSS and SASS, and Node.js. I also got interested in and started
            courses in Blender, and Unreal Engine.
