        <div className='answer'>
          Admittedly not many people would say this was their favorite show.
          Many people were not happy with the ending. I am one who does however.
          To me this show is funny, relatable, and actually deals with problems
          real people deal with. I still remember the first time I saw the
          episode where Marshal's father died. Why not friends? to me the
          difference is that friends does't really relate to these kinds of
          problems. I would say if you're a fan of just plane 'happily ever
          after', then watch friends. If you enjoy real things, real life then
          watch HIMYM. I also have a-lot of respect for the writers having an
          ending in mind and sticking to it, even when it wasn't very popular.

          Weirdly enough I would actually say that Avatar is a more perfect and
          better tv show than HIMYM. I just like HIMYM slightly better. Avatar
          is a flawless show with extraordinary story telling, comedy, and
          showing relatable problems.

          There are a lot of shows I like and some are hard to narrow down. For
          example I think the when The Office is funny. I think it's better than
          Parks and Rec, however I think Parks and Rec is more consistantly
          funnier. There's just so much I enjoy and tend to watch them in the
          background while working on a project so it's not quiet.
